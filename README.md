docker-io
=========

Dockerfile for an image providing access to the [IO Language](http://iolanguage.org/), based on Debian Stable. The build artifacts are still in the /tmp directory. 

This fails 3 tests, but I'm not familiar enough with IO to understand why. Test output is at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/cjs/c236dfbe2a6edc016d57)

Currently there is only support for the latest 2013.12.04 release.
